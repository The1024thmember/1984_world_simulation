### Objectives:
- To observe the emergent behaviour from the crowd with the social context
- To determine how many percentage of the emergent behaviour are beneficiary/ detrimental to the party
- What properties would need the emergent behaviour to equip to be able to destroy the party. (Here the emergent behaviour should be the derivative for the state, and the attributes / properties would be the derivative of the emergent behaviour, so it will be a double derivate of the state. It can be quite ambitious to discover this, in my opinion, it is kind of equivalent of setting up an earth, and observe the evolution of earth and find the formation of protein ("emergent behaviour") and then study what kind of attributes the protein need to have to kill other protein)

### Structure

- Outer party (13%)
- Proles (85%)

**Government department:**

##### Mapping of Ministries to Basic Needs for Each Class in _1984_

| **Basic Needs**              | **Proles (85%)**                                                       | **Outer Party (13%)**                                             | **Inner Party (2%)**                                                           | **Responsible Ministry**                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Physiological Needs**      | - **Ministry of Plenty:** Provides food and basic goods                | - **Ministry of Plenty:** Manages resource allocation             | - **Ministry of Plenty:** Ensures access to luxury goods                       | **Ministry of Plenty**                       |
| **Safety Needs**             | - **Ministry of Peace:** Maintains war to ensure order                 | - **Ministry of Love:** Implements surveillance and control       | - **Ministry of Love:** Oversees high-level surveillance and internal security | **Ministry of Peace** & **Ministry of Love** |

| **Ministry**           | **Primary Functions**                                                              | **Associated Classes**           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Ministry of Truth**  | Propaganda dissemination, information control, historical revisionism              | Outer Party, Inner Party         |
| **Ministry of Peace**  | Management of war efforts, military operations                                     | Outer Party, Inner Party         |
| **Ministry of Love**   | Law enforcement, surveillance (Thought Police), punishment, suppression of dissent | Inner Party, Outer Party         |
| **Ministry of Plenty** | Economic production, resource allocation, rationing                                | Proles, Outer Party, Inner Party |

We will simulate the war for random attacks (bomb attacks), the job for ministry of peace will be allocate resources for removing bomb attacks, 

The ministry of peace  consists of outer party, allocate production resources from prole to create weapons.  
- Requests from Inner party - Proles
- Effect on Inner party, outer party and proles, since the bomb attack is location based (survival or not), a failed defend on bomb attack will dramatically increase the safety needs of neighbourhood if ministry of truth does not intervene.

The ministry of plenty overlooks the production for food
- Requests for inner party - Proles
- Effect on inner party, outer party and proles, since all of them consumes food (Physiological Needs), a not hunger group of proles will dramatically increase the physiological needs if ministry of truth does not intervene.

The ministry of Love majorly monitor Outer party, rarely on Proles,
- Requests from inner party - Outer party member
- Effect on outer party (surveillance, punishment) and proles (surveillance, punishment, entertaining?)
	- Needs more interaction, the entertaining for proles based on the book is more self-evolved, the inner party doesn't really interfere, we probably need some general score for proles for deciding if they want to rebel, and how the interaction from outer party to proles encourages rebel.

The ministry of truth generates information
- Requests from inner party - Outer party member
- Effect on proles (safety need), if not function properly, rebel from proles.
